# scMAS Project

This repository contains the implementation of the scMAS model, a deep learning approach for single-cell multi-omics analysis. The model is designed to perform clustering on single-cell data from multiple modalities, such as RNA sequencing and ATAC sequencing.

## Requirements

The scMAS model was implemented using the following packages:

- Python 3.9.18
- h5py 3.11.0
- pandas 2.0.3
- scanpy 1.9.8
- PyTorch 1.13.1
- tqdm 4.66.5

To run the model, ensure these packages are installed in your Python environment.

## Usage

The code provides a comprehensive pipeline for training the scMAS model, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. For specific usage instructions and parameters, refer to the code comments and documentation within the script files.
